For project 4, you'll be asked to work on a dataset from one of the following Kaggle competitions. You have the choice of completing a regression problem, a classification problem, or an NLP-focused problem. Perform some EDA, and fit and evaluate at least two models on the dataset you've chosen.

You should turn in a repository by 5pm. It should include a README that contains a summary of your work, as well as your code.

At 4pm we will come back together for each student to present a quick lightning talk. This should be no longer than 5 minutes, and slides are not required (although you may find it useful); the lightning talk will also _not_ be graded.

You have a limited amount of time to work on this project. As such, we know your work won't be as polished as what you've turned in for previous projects. However, you should strive to do good work and turn in something that reflects your findings!

## Tips

- Don't stress too much about model performance. Some things are easier to model than others. Give it your best effort with the time permitted.
- Use outside reference materials. Other people have worked on these datasets before; you're allowed to reference the public Kaggle notebooks and other analyses so long as you provide credit and extend the analysis with your own work.
- Think about scheduling and keep an eye on the clock. It's easy to spend all day on data cleaning and run out of time on the modeling component.
- Ask a peer or instructor for help if you get stuck on the same technical problem for longer than 10-15 minutes without making progress, and ask for help if you don't know what to do next.

## Timeline

- **9:15am**: Project introduction.
- **10am**: By 10am, Slack the instructors with the dataset you've chosen.
- **After lunch, timing tbd**: Check-in with an instructor.
- **4pm**: Reconvene for lightning talks.
- **5pm**: Make sure your project work has been pushed and submitted.

## Guidelines

We know this is a short time for a project. We're not expecting anything as polished as project two or three. However, the goal is for you to have something to show for your time. **At a minimum, do some EDA and have at least two models fit and scored**.

## Rubric

When evaluated against the rubric, we'll take into account that that you had a very limited amount of time to work on this project. Depending on the problem that you choose, some parts of this rubric may not apply. Do your best with the time you have. This project will be pass/fail, with each category on the rubric being graded as pass/fail.

### Data Cleaning and EDA

- Are missing values imputed/handled appropriately?
- Are distributions examined and described?
- Are outliers identified and addressed?
- Are appropriate summary statistics provided?
- Are steps taken during data cleaning and EDA framed appropriately?

### Visualizations

- Are sufficient visualizations provided?
- Do plots accurately demonstrate valid relationships?
- Are plots labeled properly?
- Are plots interpreted appropriately?
- Are plots formatted and scaled appropriately for inclusion in a notebook-based technical report?

### Preprocessing and Modeling

- Are categorical variables appropriately handled?
- Does the student properly split and/or sample the data for validation/training purposes?
- Does the student utilize feature selection to remove noisy or multi-collinear features?
- Does the student test and evaluate a variety of models to identify a production algorithm?
- Does the student explain how the model works and evaluate its performance successes/downfalls?

### Evaluation and Conceptual Understanding

- Does the student accurately identify and explain the baseline score?
- Does the student select and use metrics relevant to the problem objective?
- Does the student interpret the results of their model for purposes of inference?
- Is domain knowledge demonstrated when interpreting results?

### Project Organization

- Are modules imported correctly (using appropriate aliases)?
- Does the README provide a good executive summary of the project?
- Is markdown formatting used appropriately to structure notebooks?
- Are there an appropriate amount of comments to support the code?
- Are files & directories organized correctly?
- Are there unnecessary files included?
- Do files and directories have well-structured, appropriate, consistent names?

### Python Syntax and Control Flow

- Is care taken to write human readable code?
- Is the code syntactically correct (no runtime errors)?
- Does the code generate desired results (logically correct)?
- Does the code follows general best practices and style guidelines?
- Are Pandas and sklearn functions used appropriately?
